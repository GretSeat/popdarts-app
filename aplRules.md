American Popdarts League (APL) Rules & Regulations

1. EQUIPMENT
Table
Tables shall be made of high-quality smooth and non-porous materials approved by the APL, ensuring durability and consistency for play.

Table dimensions: At least 24" wide x 47.5" long x 36" high.

Target Marker position: Centered both front to back and left to right on table.

Tower position: Placed in the front right corner - 24” in front of the target marker.  
Darts
Players must use APL-approved Popdarts branded for all sanctioned events (PRO series).

Players may not alter darts after purchase, including modifications to suction cups or weights.

Players must have two different color variations ready for use.

2. COURT LAYOUT
Court
The court is set up with two player boxes, each located 17 feet (18 ft when using ELITE series Popdarts for the 2026 season) from the Target Marker to the front edge of the box. These boxes define the designated throwing zones for players during gameplay.
Throwing Zones
Each players' box is a 3 feet by 4 feet rectangle located side by side.

Vertical Clearance
Indoor or covered play requires a minimum vertical clearance of 10 feet (recommend 12-15’).

3. PRE-GAME
Determine Who Goes First
Coin flip or Rock Paper Scissors determines who goes first.

The winner chooses either to go first or their side.

The referee chooses who calls the coin toss either by but not limited to ranking or home field advantage.

Each team uses three Popdarts of a single color, with each team assigned a different color to distinguish them.
Practice
Players may complete practice throws during open play sessions before the game begins.

4. GAMEPLAY
Throwing Protocol
 To start the game, the player elected to go first throws the first Popdart.
Players must alternate throws within a round to maintain a consistent rhythm of play.

The player whose turn it is to throw may leave their players’ box during their shot clock to examine dart placement, but the throw must be made from within the box with both feet remaining in the box.

The non-throwing player must remain inside their designated players’ box until the final dart of the round is released.

Once the final dart is released, both players may immediately leave their boxes.
Shot Clock
Each player has 10 seconds to throw after the previous dart has come to rest.

Exceeding the shot clock results in the loss of that throw.
Timeouts
Each team is allowed one 15-second timeout per game.

The shot clock resets after a timeout.
Gameplay Penalties
Early Exit Violation: Leaving the players’ box before the final dart is released results in a dead dart for the offending player.

The opposing player may accept or decline a rethrow.

Shot Clock Violation: Failing to throw within 10 seconds results in loss of throw.

Throwing Out of Bounds: A dart thrown from outside the players’ box is declared a dead dart and removed from play.

Challenge Timing: All challenges regarding infractions (e.g., early movement, illegal throws) must be made before the next throw occurs.

Proper Throwing Technique
A legal throw involves propelling the Popdart towards the playing table.

Players must release the dart within their designated throwing zone without stepping beyond the front edge of the players box.

Scoring
After all Popdarts have been thrown, points are awarded using Cancellation Scoring.
Cancellation Scoring
The points of one team cancel out the points of the opponent.

For example, if the blue team scores 5 points and the green team scores 2 points, the blue team wins the round with 3 points.
Scoring breakdown:
Landing on top of the Target Marker (T-Nobber): 10 points

Closest Popdart that sticks: 3 points

Each other Popdart that sticks: 1 point

Any Popdart that sticks and is touching the Target Marker (“Kiss aka Lippy”): 1 additional point

Wigglenobber™: Double the points of the Popdart it sticks to, whether it’s your team’s or the opponent’s

Fender Bender: A Popdart touches or is lodged against the Target Marker. Point Value: 1 additional point (can stack with Kiss).

Tower Shot: A Popdart lands on a designated tower shot. Point Value: 5 points.

T-Bone: No additional points

The team that was awarded points in the previous round starts the next round.

The team awarded points is responsible for ensuring that the Target Marker remains securely suctioned in place for the start of the next round.

If the Target Marker becomes unsecured during a round, the round is immediately nullified, and the team with honors forfeits honors for the next round.

First team to reach or exceed 21 points wins the game.
Advanced Rulings
If neither team gets a Popdart in play, the team who threw first loses honors and the other player goes first in the next round.

Tie Rule: If the closest Popdart from each team is equidistant from the Target Marker, the two tied Popdarts must be re-thrown, beginning with the team that originally threw first. Important: All other Popdarts remain in play during this re-throw. Once the re-throw is complete, scoring is determined, and all Popdarts are eligible to be counted toward the result.

Measurements are made by the ref using the official Popdarts Wire from the closest edge of the Popdart’s suction cup to the Target Marker.

5. PLAYER CONDUCT
General Conduct
Players must respect officials, opponents, and venue staff at all times.

Unsportsmanlike behavior, including excessive taunting or distractions, may result in warnings or penalties.

Players are responsible for ensuring their equipment complies with APL regulations.

Equipment challenges must be resolved before the game begins.

6. BROADCAST POLICY
